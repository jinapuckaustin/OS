#An orphan process is a running process whose parent process has finished 
or terminated and is adopted by sbin/init and will have a PPID of 1.
  disown -a && exit #Close a shell/terminal and force all children to be adopted
  
##Daemons##
A daemon process is an intentionally orphaned process in order to have a background process.
  #can be used for persistance check for wierds:
  #Malicious processes are sometimes orphaned and named to make it look like a daemon process 
    ps --ppid 1 -lf
      man cron #to see an example of a daemon that starts during the boot process

#Check status/start/stop/restart a service on sysV
  service <servicename> status/start/stop/restart
  
#Start/stop/restart a service
  systemctl start/stop/restart <servicename.service>
  
#Check status of a service
  systemctl status <servicename.service>
OR
  systemctl status <PID of service>

##Cronjobs, a method of persistance#
The cron daemon checks the directories 
  /var/spool/cron, #user cronjobs 
  /etc/cron.d
  /etc/crontab #system cronjobs
once a minute and executes any commands specified that match the time.

  crontab -u [user] #file This command will load the crontab data from the specified fil
  crontab -l -u [user] #This command will display/list user’s crontab contents
  crontab -r -u [user] #This Command will remove user’s crontab contents
  crontab -e -u [user] #This command will edit user’s crontab contents
  
##View File Descriptors using the LSOF command.
  #List all open files being used by every process.
    sudo lsof | tail -30
  #List all open files for a specific process.
    sudo lsof -c sshd
    
## Navigating Proc Directory
  #List all the proc directories.
    ls -l /proc/
  #Grab the PID of a process.
    ps -elf | grep sshd
  #List contents for that PID directory.
    sudo ls -l /proc/14139
